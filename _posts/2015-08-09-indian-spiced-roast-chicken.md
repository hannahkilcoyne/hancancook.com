**Indian Spiced Roast Chicken**  
  
- 1 5-6 lbs whole chicken  
- 2 inch piece of fresh ginger, grated  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed  
- 1 tbsp tomato paste  
- 1 tbsp ground coriander  
- 1 tbsp turmeric  
- 1 tbsp garam masala  
- 1 tbsp cumin  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced  
- 2 tbsp salt  
  
Preheat the oven to 400°.  
  
Mix the ginger, garlic, tomato paste, spices, olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt together in a small bowl. The mixture will form a paste.  
  
Remove the giblets from the chicken, rinse the chicken in cold water, and dry it thoroughly with paper towels. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and rub it all over with the spice mixture, inside and out (use gloves if you do not want your hards to get stained yellow by the turmeric). Optionally marinate the chicken up to overnight. (I didn't plan that far ahead with my chicken and it was fine.)  
  
Turn the heat on the oven down to 350°.  
  
Place the chicken in the oven and cook for 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes. The breast should measure 165° when the chicken is done.  
  
Allow the chicken to rest for at least 10 minutes and then carve.
