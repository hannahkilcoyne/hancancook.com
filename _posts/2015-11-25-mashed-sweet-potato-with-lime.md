The hot bar at Whole Foods sometimes has mashed sweet potato with lime, and it's so addictingly good, I wanted to try making it at home. Although I couldn't find a recipe straight from Whole Foods, I think this is pretty close.  
  
This made enough for two people. Next time I will definitely double this.  
  
  
**Mashed Sweet Potato with Lime**  
  
2 medium sweet potatoes  
3 tbsp butter, melted  
2 tbsp lime juice  
Zest of 1/2 a lime  
2 tbsp maple syrup  
Pinch of salt  
  
Set the oven to 350Â°. Wash and dry the sweet potatoes and prick each of them with a knife. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for at least an hour, until they are softened.  
  
Peel the skin from the potatoes and add the flesh to a food processor or mixer bowl. Add the butter, lime juice, lime zest, maple syrup and salt to the bowl. Pulse or whip the mixture to mash the potatoes and combine all the ingredients.
