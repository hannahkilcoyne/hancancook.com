Just in time for summer to end, my deck project is finally done!  
  

  

  

  

  

The deck started off as a red, fake cedarish solid stain. It wasn't terrible but it was starting to fade and flake off in some places. I decided that the best option would be to strip the old solid stain and re-stain the deck with a new gray solid stain. It should last longer than paint. I decided to prime and paint the railings white. [This pin](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/150166968800481535/) is what I was going for.

  

I did a ton of research before deciding on this plan, but when I went to Lowe's to buy deck stripper, the man working there told me there was no such product. Not that they didn't have it in stock, but that there was no such thing. As if I got up at 7:30 am on a Saturday in April to go to Lowe's and seek out a product that I made up. So I stormed off in a huff. And therefore, I present to you, this deck stripper from Home Depot:

  

  

  

The top is after being scrbbed with the [Behr Wood Stain and Finish Stripper](http://www.behr.com/consumer/products/wood-stains-finishes-cleaners-and-strippers/behr-premium-wood-stain-finish-stripper). The red color was still there but the flaking stain was gone. On the top is the deck after using the deck brightener/cleaner ([Behr Wood Stain and Finish Stripper](http://www.behr.com/consumer/products/wood-stains-finishes-cleaners-and-strippers/behr-premium-all-in-one-wood-cleaner)) after the stripper.

  

  

Yeah, so, suck it, guy from Lowe's.

  

  

This is how the deck looked after being stripped. 

  

  

I did two coats of Behr Solid Color Weatherproofing All-In-One Wood Stain and Sealer in  Drift Gray (SC-137). The painters ended up doing another coat in September.  

  

  

The railings were done in the same paint as the house, which was [Benjamin Moore Ultra Spec EXT in Satin](http://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-architects-and-designers/paint-products/ultra-spec-exterior-paint#piSheen=448&advs=0&tab=3) (no tint). 

  

  

  

  

That's' it!
