**Shredded Beef Tostadas**  
  
For the salsa:  
1 pint cherry tomatoes, diced  
1/2 small red onion, diced small  
1 handful chopped cilantro  
1 lime, juiced  
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  

  

6 yellow corn tortillas  
2 cups shredded beef  
1 cup shredded cheese  
1 cup shredded lettuce  
  
To prepare the salsa, combine the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside at room temperature to allow the flavor to combine.

  

Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Place the tortillas on the rack of the oven and bake until crispy, approximately 10 minutes. Watch closely to prevent the tortillas from burning. Heat the shredded beef in its liquid in a small saucepan over medium high heat.

  

To assemble the tostadas, layer the beef, cheese, lettuce and salsa on the crispy tortillas.
