This is a favorite Pioneer Woman recipe that I have made many times over the years. The ingredients don't seem like anything special, but these little burritos are really unexpectedly tasty, and they're also very quick to prepare.  
**Beef and Bean Burritos**  
  
1 onion, diced  
1 tbsp olive oil  
2 lbs ground beef  
1/2 tsp cumin  
1/2 tsp paprika  
Salt and freshly ground pepper  
1 8 oz can enchilada sauce  
1 28 oz can refried beans  
10 flour tortillas (10 inch size)  
2 cups shredded cheese  
  
Preheat the oven to 300Â°.  
  
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef and brown. Season with the cumin, paprika, salt and pepper. Pour off any fat. Stir in half of the enchilada sauce and simmer together with the beef on low for 5 minutes.  
  
Heat the refried beans in a small sauce pan over medium low heat until heated through.  
  
Wrap the tortillas in paper towels and microwave for 30 to 60 seconds to soften them. Assemble the burritos with the beef, beans and 1 cup of the cheese. Place a layer of refried beans, beef, and then shredded cheese in each tortilla, then fold the right and left sides in and roll the ingredients up. Place each burrito seam side down in a pan.  
  
Drizzle the second half of the enchilada sauce and sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of cheese over the burritos and place in the oven for 10-50 minutes, until cheese is melted.
