**Persian Rice with Tahdig**  
  
2 1/2 cups of Basmati rice  
Approx. 6 tbsp vegetable oil  
  
Add the rice to a shallow bottomed pot (I used my 6 qt dutch oven),  and rinse 3+ times, until the water that pours off begins to become clear. Fill the pot with cold water, an inch or two over the rice, and bring to a boil over high heat. Watch the rice closely. When it comes to a rolling boil, boil for 2 minutes. Test the rice, and drain it into a colander as soon as the inside feels softer than uncooked rice. It should still have some bite.  
  
Return the empty pot to the stove over medium heat. Add enough vegetable oil to generously cover the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle 3 cups of the cooked rice over the bottom of the pot and compress it gently with the back of the measuring cup to form a uniform layer of rice.   Add the rest of the cooked rice on top. Use a clean cotton dish towel to cover the pot, then place the pot cover on top of the dish towel. Continue to cook the rice on medium for 15 minutes. Then turn the heat to low, and cook for an additional 25 minutes.  
  
Flip the pot over onto a platter and serve. The tahdig should release from the bottom of the pot on its own.
