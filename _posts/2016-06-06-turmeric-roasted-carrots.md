**Turmeric Roasted Carrots**  
  
1/2 lb whole cooking carrots  
1/2 tsp turmeric  
1/4 tsp garlic powder  
1/4 tsp ground coriander  
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice  
2 tbsp olive oil  
  
Preheat the oven to 450Â° and place a large baking sheet inside.  
  
Wash the unpeeled carrots. Slice the thinner carrots in half lengthwise, then crosswise. Quarter the thicker carrots before slicing crosswise. Place the carrots in a medium mixing bowl. Sprinkle with the turmeric, garlic powder, coriander, salt and pepper and toss with a spatula to evenly cover the carrots. Add the lemon juice and olive oil, then stir again to evenly coat the carrots. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and spread the carrots out in a single, even layer. Roast for 25 minutes, until carrots begin to brown.  
  
Can easily be doubled.
