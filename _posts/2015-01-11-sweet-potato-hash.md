**Sweet Potato Hash**  
  
One large sweet potato  
One large yellow onion  
2 tablespoons of butter  
Salt and fresh ground black pepper  
  
Begin bringing a pot of water to boil while you peel and dice the sweet potato. Add the sweet potato to the pot and boil it just long enough for the potatoes to feel slightly soft. If you add the potato while the water is still coming to a boil, they should only need to be in the boiling water for a minute or two.  
  
While the potatoes boil, dice the onion. Heat a pan on medium heat and add the butter to the pan.  
  
Drain the potatoes and add them to the heated pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes before adding the onions. Season generously with salt and pepper. Fry the potatoes and onions together for 10-15 minutes until they are browned.  
  
Serves 2.
