This baked french toast is an Easter Brunch staple. Like most Pioneer Woman recipes, it's really over the top -- never in my life have I made something with two entire tablespoons of vanilla extract before. I'm a big fan of bread pudding, which is basically what this is. You can make this ahead and keep it in the fridge overnight before baking.

## Ingredients

- 1 (16 oz) baguette
- 8 eggs
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4  tsp salt
- Pinch of nutmeg
- 1 stick of butter

## Instructions

1. Butter a 9x13 pan. Tear or cut a the baguette into roughly 1 inch pieces and distribute them in the pan. 
1. Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, sugar and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Pour the egg mixture over the bread. Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to bake, between 1 hour and overnight. 
1. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Cut in the butter and mix together until crumbs are formed. Cover and store in the refrigerator separately.  
1. Before baking, preheat the oven to 350Â°. Sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top of the casserole. Bake for 45 minutes for a texture resembling bread pudding (which is what I like). Bake longer for a firmer texture.
