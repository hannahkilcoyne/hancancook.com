The first place I ever drove by myself was to 5 Guys for some cajun fries. I love them. I recently did some research into the cajun seasoning and learned that [McCormick Gourmet Cajun Seasoning](https://www.amazon.com/McCormick-Gourmet-Collection-Cajun-Seasoning/dp/B0029K51ZI) is the same stuff they use at 5 Guys. Baked potato wedges are not the same thing as fries, but these came out very tasty and super spicy. I will definitely make these again.  
  

  
**Cajun Potato Wedges**  
  
2 large russet potatoes  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1.5 tbsp cajun seasoning (I used McCormick)  
  
Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Place a large sheet pan in the oven to preheat.  
  
Wash the potatoes thoroughly and slice each potato into 12 wedges. In a large bowl, drizzle the potato wedges with the olive oil, and sprinkle with the cajun seasoning. Toss the wedges to coat them evenly with the seasoning.  
  
Remove the sheet pan from the oven and line the potato wedges up on the pan, so that none are touching. Bake for 35 - 45 minutes until the potatoes begin to brown.  
  
Can easily be doubled.
