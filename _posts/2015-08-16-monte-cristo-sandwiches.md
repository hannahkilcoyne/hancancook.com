**Monte Cristo Sandwiches**  
  
Serves 2  
  
2 eggs  
3 tbsp light cream  
4 slices bakery white bread  
1 tbsp butter  
Deli ham (I used Boar's Head Black Forest Ham)  
Deli turkey (optional) (I used Boar's Head Maple Glazed Turkey)  
Swiss cheese (I used Boar's Head Baby Swiss)  
1 tbsp powdered sugar  
  
Heat a griddle to 325Â° (or a frying pan over medium low). Melt half of the butter on the griddle.  
  
Beat the eggs and cream in a shallow bowl. Dip each slice of bread in the egg mixture, fully coating each side, and place on the griddle. Flip the bread when the first side is browned, using the second half of the butter to re-butter the griddle.  
  
Assemble the sandwiches with the swiss cheese, ham, and turkey, according to each person's preference. Grill each sandwich until heated through and until the cheese is melted.  
  
Dust the sandwiches with powdered sugar, slice in half, and serve.
