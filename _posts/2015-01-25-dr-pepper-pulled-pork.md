**Dr. Pepper Pulled Pork**  
4 lb bone-in pork shoulder  
2 medium yellow onions, quartered  
1/2 can (7 ounces) chipotles in adobo sauce (about 3 peppers plus the sauce)  
24 ounces (2 cans) Dr. Pepper  
  
Preheat oven to 300°. To prepare the pork shoulder, trim off the large portions of fat. Heat the pot or dutch oven on high for 1 minute, and then sear the first side of the pork for 30 seconds or so. Let the pot gather heat for another few seconds, then sear the second side of the pork. Remove the pork from the pot and add the onions to the bottom. Replace the pork and add 24 ounces of Dr. Pepper to the pot.  
  
Cook the pork for 4-6 hours. I checked on the pork at 4 hours and took it out at 4 and a half hours. At that stage it had completely fallen off the bone and came apart with no effort, which is the goal.  
  
Recipe is from my favorite, [PW](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2011/03/spicy-dr-pepper-shredded-pork/). Next time I would go with the full can of chipotles from the original recipe, to add a little more spice.
