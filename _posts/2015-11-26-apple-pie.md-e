**Apple Pie**

  
6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (~5 medium granny smith apples and 1 medium red apple)  
¾ cup sugar  
2 tbsp flour  
¾ tsp cinnamon  
¼ tsp salt  
⅛ tsp nutmeg  
2 tbsp butter  
  
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place 1 pie crust in an ungreased 9 inch pie pan.  
  
In a large bowl gently mix all ingredients. Scoop into crust lined pie pan. Top with second crust. Place pats of butter over the top of the filling. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing together to seal. Cut slits in the top crust.  
  
Bake 40-45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. To prevent excess browning cover edges of crust with tin foil.
