The idea for this recipe came from my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered Snickers Cheesecake, and while it was tasty, it was just regular cheesecake with Snickers mixed in. I really felt like the perfect Snickers cheesecake would be a peanut butter base instead of plain. I intended to try out my idea as soon as Halloween candy started appearing in the grocery store (which these days is in the middle of summer), but I didn't get it done before the Halloween aisle was replaced with Christmas-in-October.  

  

This year, our plan to entice more than the pitiful 5 trick-or-treaters we had in 2014 included handing out full size candy bars. (Plain failed, in case you were wondering.) Just before I abandoned the idea of this cheesecake completely, I realized that I had enough left over Snickers bars to finally make my cheesecake dreams come true!

  

This is the perfect recipe to use up all your leftover Halloween candy. The best part of the recipe, for me, is a tie between the chewy caramel in the Snickers, and the extra thick Oreo crust. I'm sure there are a lot of possible variations you could make with different candy bars as well. Next time, I might just try making the crust without the Oreo cream, since it's not personally my favorite part of the cookie.
