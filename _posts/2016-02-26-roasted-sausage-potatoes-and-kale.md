**Roasted Sausage, Potatoes and Kale**  
  
3 medium russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into half inch cubes  
1 onion, chopped large  
1 lb sweet Italian sausage, sliced into half inch slices  
4 tbsp olive oil, divided  
4 tbsp lemon juice (approx. 1/2  lemon), divided  
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  
5 oz package of baby kale or about 4 leaves of regular kale, washed, de-stemmed and torn into pieces  
  
Preheat the oven to 425° and place two empty baking sheets in the oven to preheat.  
  
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the potatoes to a the boiling water. Parboil the potatoes until they are just beginning to become tender, approximately 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes well and allow them to fully dry.  
  
In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, onion and sausage. Add 2 tbsp of the olive oil, 2 tbsp of lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Stir together to coat everything with the olive oil.  
  
Remove the baking sheets from the oven and divide the mixture across the two baking sheets, distributing everything evenly so that the pans are not crowded. Bake for 25 minutes, until the potatoes are browning and the sausage is cooked through.  
  
In another bowl, dress the kale with the remaining 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Massage the dressing into the kale so that it is well coated. Toss the kale in with the sausage and potatoes, and return to the oven for a remaining 10 minutes. When kale is beginning to crisp, remove from the oven and serve.
