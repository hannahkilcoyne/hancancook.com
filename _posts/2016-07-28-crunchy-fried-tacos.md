I had never cooked with soft corn tortillas until I discovered this recipe. At my first job, one of my favorite tasks was frying corn tortillas to make crispy taco shells, but the idea of frying whole tacos really blew my mind. While I can't say I make these too often, because they are pretty heavy, they are as delicious as you would think they are. You can make these with whatever fillings you like; I am suggesting ground beef and black beans, but some fresh pico de gallo would be a welcome addition as well.  
  

**Crunchy Fried Tacos**  
  
1 14 oz can of black beans  
1/2 tsp onion powder  
1/2 tsp garlic powder  
1/2 tsp cumin  
1/4 tbsp smoked paprika  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  
2-3 tbsp vegetable oil  
8 soft corn tortillas  
1 lb [taco seasoned ground beef](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2016/07/taco-seasoned-ground-beef.html)Â (optional)  
2 cups shredded cheese (I used cheddar)  
  
In a small saucepan, heat the black beans (not drained or rinsed) over medium heat. Season with the onion powder, garlic powder, cumin and paprika. Salt and pepper to taste.  
  
Heat a skillet on medium. Add the vegetable oil to the hot pan. Divide the ground beef (if using), black beans, and cheese across eight tacos. And assemble and fry each taco one or two at a time, until the crust is crunchy.
