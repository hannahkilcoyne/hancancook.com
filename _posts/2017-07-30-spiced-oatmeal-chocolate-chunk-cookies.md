Funny story -- I had to trash the first batch of these cookies because I dumped in lemon extract, which I forgot I even owned, instead of vanilla. I'm really glad I persevered though, because these cookies came out great.  
  
I liked this recipe a lot because it made big cookies that were the perfect combination of crispy and chewy. I am not a fan of raw/underdone cookies, but these were easy to make nice and big without risking them being underdone, or worse, that terrible combination of raw and burnt. The spice combination is great, and I would challenge you to find one person who prefers raisins to chocolate chunks. I left out the pecans this time because of allergies, but I am sure they would be amazing with pecans, and I will definitely try that next time.
