This chili recipe is one of the first things I ever cooked, so I have a lot of nostalgia towards it.  
  
Chili is a great thing to make when you're first learning to cook, because there's a lot of chopping, a lot of measuring spices, and a lot of stirring. It really makes you feel like you're _cooking_. But it's a great beginner meal to start out with. Since everything just eventually needs to end up in the pot, precise timing is not important. No matter what, this chili comes out great and is a real crowd pleaser. Even though this seems to be one of the most popular chili recipes on the internet, this is "my" go to chili recipe, and I highly recommend it.  
  
  
Drain off the excess grease. Prep the onion, celery and garlic while the meat browns.  
  
Add the beans, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste and stir to combine. Then add the onion, celery, garlic, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire, oregano, cumin, basil and smoked paprika. Stir to combine and simmer over low heat for 2 hours.  
  
After two hours, taste the chili and season with salt and pepper. Serve with jalape√±o, shredded cheese and sour cream.  
  
Consume within 3 days, or freeze the left overs.
