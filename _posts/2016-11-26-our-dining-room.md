As a follow up to my [triumphant post](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2016/11/the-ghosts-room.html) about stripping my last strip of wallpaper, I realized I should finally bring it full circle and post about the first room I stripped the wallpaper from in this house.

Flashing back to what the room looked like when it was all white:

  

  

  

I wouldn't call it 'done' but it has certainly changed since we bought the house. Time for some afters!

  

  

  

We didn't own any dining chairs or a table when we moved in, so this room was totally empty for a long time, and now we are gradually adding things. I wrote about the [table](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/03/our-new-table.html) when it first got delivered. The windsor side chairs came from Target, and the comfy end chairs came from Restoration Hardware. I found the workshop that made the table, the antique cabinet in the corner, and the framed prints of [beer and food pairings](https://www.etsy.com/shop/redcruiser) all on Etsy.
