![Image of Lemon and Rosemary Risotto.](/upload/lr.jpg)

If you look at the recipes I've posted so far, you'd probably think I'm a lemon superfan. I'm not, really, or at least it is not something I've noticed about myself before now. Again, I am not sure what possessed me to make risotto when it was 96° out, which was even hotter than it was [last time](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/08/bacon-and-parmesan-risotto.html) I decided to make risotto (when it was only a cool 90°). Although I did genuinely break a sweat standing over the stove, it was worth it, since this risotto turned out to be so tasty. I was worried that the lemon wouldn't be strong enough or the rosemary would be overpowering, but both those fears were unfounded. I will definitely make this recipe again.  
  

  
  
**Lemon and Rosemary Risotto**  
  
1 qt vegetable stock  
2 shallots  
2 small ribs celery (or one large)  
1/4 cup butter (divided)  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1 cup arborio rice  
2 small (or 1 large) chicken breasts, diced into 1 inch pieces  
1 egg yolk  
4 tbsp parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish  
Zest of 1 lemon  
Juice of 1/2 lemon  
2 small sprigs of fresh rosemary  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
  
Bring the vegetable stock to a boil and then reduce to a simmer so that it can be added to the rice hot. Chop the shallots and celery finely in a food processor.  
  
Cook the diced chicken in a nonstick pan at medium high and until cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Set aside. (This could be done in one pot before starting the risotto- I cooked the chicken in a separate pan at the same time as the rice to save time.)  
  
Heat a heavy bottomed pot (I used my dutch oven) over medium low heat. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and add the olive oil. Sauté the  celery and shallots until softened, 3-4 minutes. Stir in the rice and allow it to absorb the flavors for a minute or two. Then, add 1 cup of stock and stir continuously with a silicone spatula until the liquid is absorbed. Continue one cup at a time until rice is al dente, 20-30 minutes. Add salt and black pepper, tasting as you go along. Remember that the liquid will evaporate, so be careful not to over salt the liquid initially. There may be a bit of stock leftover once the rice is fully cooked.  
  
Stir the egg yolk, parmesan cheese and lemon juice together in a small bowl.  
  
Once the rice is al dente, remove from heat. Stir in the chicken, the lemon zest, the rosemary, and the egg yolk mixture. Finally, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.
