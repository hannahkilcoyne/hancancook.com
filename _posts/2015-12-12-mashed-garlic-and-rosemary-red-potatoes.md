**Mashed Red Potatoes with Garlic and Rosemary**  
  
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter  
6 sprigs fresh rosemary  
4 cloves garlic, diced into large pieces  
5 lbs red potatoes  
1/2 - 1 cup milk  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
  
Melt the butter in a heavy bottomed sauce pan and turn to low. Add the rosemary and the garlic to the pan and stir.  
  
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil on the stove. Peel half of the potatoes and leave the skins on half. Scrub the potatoes well. Halve and then quarter the potatoes and add them to the pot.  
  
Boil the potatoes just until they are soft enough that they break apart when stabbed with a fork. Drain the potatoes and add them to the bowl of your mixer. Add the melted butter and enough milk to reach the desired consistency. Whip the potatoes until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.
