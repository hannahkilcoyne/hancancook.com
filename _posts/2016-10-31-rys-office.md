Funny story... When I posted about painting [Ryan's office](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2016/08/scholar-green-for-office.html),Â my one subscriber (that would be Ryan) noticed something. As it turns out I painted the office the wrong color! The color was supposed to be [Windsor](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Ralph-Lauren-1-gal-Windsor-Flat-Interior-Paint-RL1717F/205175142), but I painted it [Scholar Green](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Ralph-Lauren-1-gal-Scholar-Green-Flat-Interior-Paint-RL1641F/205175178). Oops.  
  
I'm not totally opposed to repainting, as it is a tiny room. But everything was already moved in, so for now, it's staying scholar green.  
  

  
This is how the room looked when we first saw the house.  
  

  

  
This is how the same angle looks now.
