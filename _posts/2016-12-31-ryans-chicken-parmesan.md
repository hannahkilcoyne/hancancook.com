I'm very excited to have this guest post from Ryan. If we're not including grilling or smoking, I would call Chicken Parmesan his signature dish. If you have ever been so lucky as to try it, and asked yourself "how did it get so crispy?" your answer is finally here. Without further ado:

## Ingredients

- Breadcrumbs, 4C Seasoned brand.  Don't use Panko or any otherÂ fancy stuff.
- Two eggs, maybe three.
- Thinly sliced chicken cutlets
- Vegetable or olive oil.
- Marinara sauce.  I like Emeril's Tomato & Basil Sauce.
- Mozzarella cheese
- Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Coat a hot frying pan with vegetable or olive oil.  I like vegetable oil, but have used olive oil because it was closer and I'm lazy.  I didn't notice a difference.  Then again, I think sausage, egg, and cheese McGriddles is the apex of culinary creation.
1. Crack two eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork.  In another bowl, pour about an inch or two of breadcrumbs.
1. Individually, dip each chicken cutlet in the egg and then coat with breadcrumbs.  Be very thorough.  Once coated, place in the pan.  Repeat with all of your chicken cutlets.  By the time you're finished filling the pan, it's likely you'll be ready to start flipping the first cutlet.  You're just looking to brown the breading.  Make sure it's crispy before flipping.
1. As those finish, transfer them to a plate and repeat the breading and browning process.
1. When you're done... do it again.  Triple bread 'em.
1. Pour some sauce in a pan, evenly space your chicken and cover in grated mozzarella cheese.
1. Bake them in an oven pre-heated to 450 degrees for about 20 minutes.
