Here's a recipe I tested ahead of Thanksgiving. This recipe is super easy, comes out pretty and is a little more unexpected than a classic pumpkin pie. Compared to pumpkin, this pie is much sweeter and has a beautiful smooth texture. Give it a try!

## Ingredients

- Dough for 1 pie crust, rolled out in a 9 inch pie pan
- 2 sweet potatoes (to yield 2 cups, mashed), peeled and cut into large pieces
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 10 oz evaporated milk, divided
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°
1. Add the potatoes to a saucepan. Fill the pan with water to reach the top of the potatoes and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook for 20 - 30 minutes until potatoes are completely soft when tested with a knife. Drain potatoes well. Measure two packed cups of sweet potato to return to the saucepan. Set aside any excess sweet potato for a different purpose, or discard.
1. Add the brown sugar, spices, salt, butter and half of the evaporated milk to the saucepan. Cook down the sweet potatoes on medium low for about 10 minutes. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture completely smooth. Remove from heat.
1. In a large bowl, mix the remaining evaporated milk, sugar, eggs and vanilla. Add the warm sweet potato mixture gradually into the egg mixture. Pour the batter into the pie crust.
1. Place the pie into the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 325°. Bake for 45-50 minutes until the center of the pie is set and not jiggly. 
1. Cool completely before serving.
