**Bacon and Parmesan Risotto**  
  
5 slices of thick cut bacon, sliced into 1/2 inch pieces  
6 cups low sodium chicken stock  
1/4 cup salted butter (divided)  
1 small onion, small dice  
1 cup arborio rice  
2/3 cup dry white wine (I used Pinot Grigio)  
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  
3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped  
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese  
  
  
First, render the pieces of bacon in a frying pan over low to medium low heat. Keep the heat low enough that the bacon does not crackle or spit, to avoid burning it. Cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until the fat melts from the meat, which will take about 20 minutes. This will result in delicious chewy pieces of bacon, rather than crispy bits.  
  
While rendering the bacon, bring the stock to a boil in a sauce pan, then turn it down to medium low heat and keep it warm on the stove.  
  
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy bottomed pan (I used my dutch oven) and sauté the onion in the butter until translucent. Add the rice and stir it together for a moment with a silicone spatula. Add the wine and stir until the liquid is mostly evaporated. Add 1 cup of the hot stock and continue to stir until the liquid is mostly evaporated. Continue one cup at a time until rice is al dente, about 30 minutes. Add salt and black pepper, tasting as you go along. Remember that the liquid will evaporate, so be careful not to over salt the liquid. There may be a bit of stock leftover once the rice is fully cooked.  
  
Once the rice is al dente, remove from heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, the parsley, the parmesan cheese and the bacon pieces. Taste the risotto, add more salt and/or pepper as necessary, and serve!
