I am so happy to have found this recipe! This queso is similar to the best queso in the world, Moe's Queso.

  

**Queso**

1 tbsp olive oil

1/2 small white onion, diced small

1 small jalapeño, diced small (optional)

1 lb white American cheese (deli)

1/4 cup light cream

1/4 to 1 cup hot water

2 Roma tomatoes, diced

1/2 bunch (~1/2 cup) chopped cilantro

  

Heat the oil in a sauce pan. Saute the onion (and jalapeno, if using) on medium low until the onion is translucent. 

  

Add the cheese and the cream to the pan. Allow the cheese to melt slowly, stirring so that it does not scorch. Add hot water in small amounts as needed to help loosen the mixture.

  

Once the queso has reached the desired consistency, add the chopped tomato, stir in the cilantro, and serve!

  

Reheat in microwave.
