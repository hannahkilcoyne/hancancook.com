The inspiration for this cake is Oatly strawberry ice cream. The ice cream is very smooth and creamy, and to me, the strawberry does a great job hiding the "non dairy" taste that other dairy free ice creams have. I have always thought it would make a great ice cream cake. I decided to pair it with chocolate cake, and the cake stole the show. It is rich and fudgey, and the texture is almost brownie-like after being taken out of the freezer. I flavored the coco whip frosting  with powdered freeze dried strawberries, but it made the whipped cream sticky and hard to work with, so I would skip the strawberry next time.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 scant cup oat milk
- 2 cups (284 grams) all purpose flour
- 2 cups (397 g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (113 g) cocoa powder
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (113 grams) vegetable oil 
- 8 ounces (227 grams) hot coffee
- 2 pints Oatly strawberry frozen desert
- 1 package (9 oz) So Delicious Coco Whip

## Instructions

### Cakes

1. Preheat oven to 335Â°. Grease and line two 6" cake pans with parchment (plus ~1 dozen mini cupcake liners for excess batter)
1. In a large measuring cup, add 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar, and then fill the rest of the cup with oat milk to make a buttermilk mixture.  
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt and mix together to evenly combine. Add in the eggs, buttermilk mixture, oil and vanilla and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Scrape the side of the bowl. Then add the hot coffee and mix on low until it is just combined. 
1. Divide the batter equally into the two cake pans (there will be extra). Bake on the center rack of the oven for approx. 36 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. 
1. Allow the cakes to cool until the pans can be handled, then slide a knife around the edge of the pan and turn the cakes out. Remove the domes from the cakes to flatten them, wrap the cakes in plastic wrap, and freeze for 4 hours or overnight. 

### Ice cream layer

1. Allow ice cream to soften for 30 minutes to make it more spreadable. Line a 6" cake pan with tin foil. 
1. Spread the softened ice cream in the pan and smooth it out to remove any bubbles. Return to the freezer for 4 hours or overnight.


### Assembly 

1. 4 hours before assembling, remove the coco whip from the freezer to the fridge to allow it to soften.
1. Remove and unwrap the cake layers from the freezer. Remove the tin foil from the ice cream later. 
1. Working quickly, stack a 6" cardboard cake round, the first layer of cake (with the sliced dome facing up), the ice cream layer, and the second layer of cake (with the sliced dome facing down) on a cake stand. 
1. Apply a thin crumb coat of the coco whip to the cake and return it to the freezer for 15 minutes to allow it to harden. 
1. Apply a thicker layer of coco whip to the cake and decorate as desired. Serve immediately or return to the freezer and defrost for up to an hour before serving.
