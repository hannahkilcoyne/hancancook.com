This is hardly a recipe, but I learned a cool new way to make less tannic (or is it satanic?) iced tea from [my favorite YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84UADOS7RsA). I used Celestial Seasonings Sangria Zinger this time. Tazo Passion tea is one of my favorites. Argo Fruit Sangria is another favorite.  
  
**Cold Brew Hibiscus Tea**  
  
6 hibiscus tea bags  
4 cups cold filtered water  
  
Add the tea to a glass pitcher or carafe. Top with cold water. Allow the tea to steep for 24 hours before consuming. That's it!
