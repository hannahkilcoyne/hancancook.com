I made this bruschetta to complement my [No-Knead Bread](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2017/12/no-knead-bread.html). I like this recipe because you dispense with the seeds and water in the tomatoes. That way, the mixture isn't too wet and doesn't make the toast soggy. The fresh basil and garlic gives the bruschetta a fresh flavor.

## Ingredients

- 12 oz package of tomatoes (I used a mix of sweet yellow, orange and red cherry tomatoes)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 tbsp golden balsamic vinegar
- 1 small bunch of basil
- 2 small cloves of garlic, one minced or pressed, and 1 whole                                                           
- 1 tbsp grated parmesan and Romano cheese (optional)
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1/2 loaf of baguette or other crusty bread (try the No-Knead Bread I posted earlier!)

## Instructions

1. Slice the top off of each tomato and squeeze out the seeds. Discard the seeds. Dice or tear the tomato flesh and add to a small bowl.
1. To the tomatoes, add the olive oil, balsamic vinegars, basil and garlic. Sprinkle in the cheese and stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste.
1. Preheat the oven to 350°. Slice the bread into half inch slices and place on a wire rack. Toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, until the bread is lightly toasted. 
1. Remove the toast from the oven and rub each slice with the whole clove of garlic. When ready to serve, spoon the tomato mixture over each toast.
