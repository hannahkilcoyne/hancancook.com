**Barbacoa**  
  
1 tbsp oil  
2 lb chuck roast, fat trimmed, cut into 3-4 pieces  
1 onion, diced  
4 cloves garlic, diced or pressed  
1 tbsp cumin  
1 tbsp oregano  
1/2 cup beer (I used corona)  
4 chipotles in adobo sauce (optional, to taste) (I will leave these out next time)  
1 lime, juiced  
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
1/4 tsp ground cloves  
2 bay leaves  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  
  
Preheat oven to 275°.  
  
Heat the oil over medium heat in a dutch oven or other heavy bottomed pot. Sear any trimmings from the beef, just to develop flavor, and then discard. Sauté the onion in the remaining oil until translucent, stirring up any brown bits from the beef off of the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic, cumin and oregano and cook for one additional minute. Add the beer, chipotles (if using), lime, vinegar, gloves and bay leaves. Salt and pepper to taste. If desired, use an immersion blender to puree the mixture.  
  
Add the chunks of beef to the sauce - they may not be fully submerged at first. Place the dutch oven in the preheated oven for 3-4 hours, checking occasionally. When it's ready, the beef should shred apart with no effort - if the beef is still tough, it needs more time. Mine was ready after 3 hours.  
  
Discard the bay leaves. Shred the beef apart, mixing it in with the remaining sauce. You are ready to serve!
