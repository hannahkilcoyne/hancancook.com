**Kale Chips**  
  
1 bunch curly kale, washed, de-stemmed and torn into pieces  
3 - 4 tbsp olive oil  
3 - 4 lemon juice  
Salt and freshly ground pepper  
  
Preheat the oven to 425Â° and place two empty baking sheets in the oven to preheat.  
  
In a large bowl, dress the kale with the olive oil and lemon juice, then salt and pepper to taste. Massage the dressing into the kale so that it is well coated.  
  
Remove the baking sheets from the oven and divide the kale across the two baking sheets, distributing it evenly so that the pans are not crowded. Roast the kale for 9 - 10 minutes. When kale is beginning to crisp, remove from the oven and serve.
