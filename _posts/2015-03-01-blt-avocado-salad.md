I have said it before and I will say it again. Bacon and avocado is one of life's great flavor combinations. This is my favorite salad, and I had the urge to make it today even though it is not summer yet, avocados are not really in season, and there was no corn on the cob at the supermarket for me to add to the salad. I generally believe that salads are better when you are not the person who makes them, but this one is an exception. It's super good even when you make it yourself.

  

  

**BLT Avocado Salad**

  

1/2 pound of bacon

5 oz of lettuce\*

3-4 tbspÂ [Cilantro Vinaigrette](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/03/cilantro-vinaigrette.html)

1/2 cup grape tomatoes, sliced

1 avocado, sliced

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

  

Cut the slices of bacon into thirds. Cook the bacon and set it aside to drain. Slice the tomatoes and dice the avocado. Dress the greens lightly with the cilantro vinaigrette. Toss the bacon, tomatoes and avocado in with the greens. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

  

Serves 2, as a meal, or more as a side.

  

\*I used spring mix type lettuce. This salad is also great with romaine or butter lettuce for more crunch, and arugula also works well with this flavor combination.
