![Image of Chicken Stock.](/upload/stock.jpg)

When I have a leftover roast chicken, I use it to make my own chicken stock. An easy way to make stock basically for free is to start with a [boil](http://donnafreedman.com/2014/10/10/boiling-bag/) [bag](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/turning-kitchen-waste-into-something-sublime/). Save unused onions, carrots, celery and parsley in a bag in the freezer for the next time you make stock. The amounts will not be exact, but this recipe doesn't need to be exact.  
  
  
  
**Chicken Stock**  
  
1 chicken carcass  
Onions  
Carrots  
Celery  
Parsley  
2 cloves garlic  
12 cups water  
  
Combine all ingredients in a large stockpot. Bring to a boil, then lower to a strong simmer. Continue cooking, uncovered, for about 2 hours.  
  
Strain the stock and refrigerate in a covered container until chilled. Spoon off any fat that has collected at the top of the container. If not using immediately, measure into freezer bags in 2 cup intervals.
