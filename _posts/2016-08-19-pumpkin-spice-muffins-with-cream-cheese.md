I blew all my money on Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Pumpkin Muffins the first semester I lived in Boston. So naturally I pinned [this recipe](http://www.annies-eats.com/2010/10/08/pumpkin-cream-cheese-muffins/) for knock off Starbucks Pumpkin Muffins ages ago, and eventually tried it out. The muffins were good, but the recipe was a lot of work and I haven't made it again. I went searching again for another pumpkin muffin recipe, and I'm so glad I found this one.

  

  

**Pumpkin Spice Muffins with Cream Cheese Swirl**  
  
For the muffins:  
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour  
1/2 tsp cinnamon  
Pinch allspice  
Pinch cloves  
Pinch nutmeg  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt (1 tsp coarse salt)  
1 15oz can of pumpkin  
1 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 cup packed brown sugar  
2 large eggs  
1/2 cup vegetable oil  
1 tbsp vanilla extract  
  
For the cream cheese swirl:  
8 oz cream cheese, softened  
1/4 cup granulated sugar  
1 large egg yolk  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
  
Preheat oven to 375Â°.  
  
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, spices, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl or the bowl of a mixer, beat together the pumpkin, sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla extract. Add the dry ingredients, and mix to combine.  
  
Place the muffin cups into the muffin tins, and fill each cup 3/4 full.  
  
In a small bowl, beat together the cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk and vanilla extract. Place a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture on top of each muffin and swirl with a toothpick.  
  
Bake for 22-26 minutes until a knife comes out clean from the center of a muffin. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack and serve. Store in refrigerator.  
  
Makes 18 muffins.
