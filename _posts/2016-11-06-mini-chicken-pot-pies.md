I have updated the [Individual Chicken Hand Pies](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/09/individual-chicken-hand-pies.html) I posted last year to make these Mini Chicken Pot Pies. The hand pies have a high crust to filling ratio, which I love, but it's not everyone's favorite. And as anyone who knows me knows, I'm just the kind of person who is very accommodating and responsive to feedback. These pot pies turned out great, and it's a little less work to make them this way, so I will probably make them like this from now on. Everyone's happy!  
  

  
**Mini Chicken Pot Pies**  
  
3 chicken breasts (about 1.5 lb of chicken)  
1 medium potato (or two small potatoes), diced  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1 onion, diced  
3 medium carrots, diced  
2 medium stalks of celery, diced  
2 cloves garlic  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
1 tsp herbes de provence  
1 tbsp butter  
1/4 cups all purpose flour  
2 cups chicken stock  
2 pie crusts (I use store bought, one box has 2 crusts)  
  
Preheat the oven to 425°. Heat a pan on medium low, add the oil, and cook the chicken breasts, covered, for 10-15 minutes until cooked through. Set the chicken breasts aside until they are cool enough to handle.  
  
Add the diced potato to a small pot of water and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, about 2-3 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside.  
  
Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic to the same pan that you cooked the chicken in, and cook at medium heat until the vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Season the vegetables generously with salt and pepper.  
  
While the vegetables are cooking, shred the chicken by hand or with a fork. Add the chicken, potatoes and butter to the pan and sprinkle the flour over the mixture. Add the stock and stir everything together. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. When the flour activates and the mixture begins to thicken, remove it from heat.  
  
Roll out the pie crusts and cut out 4 circles the size of your ramekins. Fill each ramekin and cover each one with a pie crust lid. Crimp around the edges.   
  
Place the ramekins on a cookie sheet. Bake for ~20 minutes until golden brown.  
  
Makes 4 16 oz ramekins.
