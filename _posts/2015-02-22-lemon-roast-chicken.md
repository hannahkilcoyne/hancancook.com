Roast chicken for Sunday dinner is one of the best things in the world. That is just a fact. I served this Lemon Roast Chicken with [Lemon Rosemary Potatoes](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/02/lemon-rosemary-potatoes.html), because sometimes more is more.  
  
  
  
**Lemon Roast Chicken**  
  
1 whole chicken (mine was 6 lbs)  
2 lemons, one juiced and one whole  
Salt and freshly ground pepper  
Fresh rosemary  
  
Preheat the oven to 400°.  
  
Remove the giblets from the chicken, rinse with cold water, and pat the chicken dry.  
  
Pour the juice of one lemon over the chicken and inside the cavity of the chicken. Prick the second lemon with a knife on both sides and place it in the cavity of the chicken. Generously cover the chicken with salt and pepper. Add fresh rosemary to the cavity of the chicken.  
  
Place the chicken in a roasting pan, breast up. Add the chicken to the oven and immediately reduce the oven temperature to 350°. Cook the chicken for 20 minutes per pound, plus 15 additional minutes, or until the internal temperature of the breast reaches 165°.  
  
Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes before carving.
