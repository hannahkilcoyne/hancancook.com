Realistically there's still tons of snow on the ground, there is more snow coming, and it is still winter. But this week it cracked 60Â°, the sun stayed up past 6:00 pm, and I made my first batch of cold brew iced coffee. Feels like spring!  

  

  

  
**Cold Brew Iced Coffee**  
  
12 oz (~4 cups) course ground coffee  
6 quarts cold, filtered water  
  
Whisk the coffee into the water. Let the mixture sit for 24 hours (or longer is fine) in the refrigerator.  
  
Use a fine strainer and 2 or 3 layers of cheese cloth to strain the grounds from the coffee.  
  
Store the iced coffee covered in the refrigerator for as long as you like. This is about a week's worth of iced coffee in the summer!  
  
The coffee to water ratio can be adjusted to your liking. I have experimented with different ratios and this is the one I like. I usually make this iced coffee with Starbucks blonde roast.
