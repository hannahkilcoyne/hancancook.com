The first time I made these relatively healthy looking twice-baked potatoes, I hedged my bets and made a batch of regular [potato skins](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2016/10/potato-skins.html) as well. Today, I chose these as my Week 1 2019 Patriots season football snack without a backup option, knowing that they would disappear off the plate. If you're ever searching for a meat and dairy free appetizer that other people will actually want to eat, I highly recommend these potatoes. This recipe can be doubled easily.

## Ingredients

- 4 small russet potatoes
- 4 tbsp olive oil, divided
- 1 cup packed arugula (about half of a 5 oz package), chopped
- 3 tbsp chives, finely chopped 
- 4 tbsp scallions, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- Zest of 1/2 lemon
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°. Rub each potato with olive oil (about 1 tbsp total across 4 potatoes) and sprinkle each with salt. Prick each potato and bake on a baking sheet for about 1 hour, until the inside of the potatoes are soft. Set aside until cool enough to handle.
1. Increase oven temperature to 450°. In a small bowl, add the garlic to the lemon juice and allow to sit to remove some bite from the garlic. Combine the arugula, chives, scallions, lemon zest, garlic, lemon juice and the remaining 3 tbsp olive oil. Slice each potato in half and scoop out the centers, leaving a 1/4 inch shell behind. Mash the centers of the potatoes into the greens until fully combined and smooth
1. Arrange the potato shells on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fill each shell with an equal portion of the potato and greens mixture. Return the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges begin to brown. Serve warm.
