My mom stopped by today to bake a batch of these Vanilla Sugar Cookies with me. This recipe is one of my favorites - in fact it's the top entry in my "Treasured Recipes" Google doc. The recipe originally comes from my grandmother, and according to my mom, my Grandmother stumbled upon it randomly in an Ekco cookware promotional cookbook. These cookies have been my family's traditional sugar cookies for my entire life. It's the shortening that gives these cookies a unique flaky texture, and it also makes them extremely addictive.

**Vanilla Sugar Cookies**

  

½ cup shortening (i.e. Crisco or Butter Flavored Crisco)

1 cup sugar

2 large eggs beaten

1 tbsp cream

½ tsp vanilla

2 ½ cups flour

2 tsp baking powder

½ tsp nutmeg

  
  

Preheat oven to 400°

  
  

Blend shortening and sugar until creamy. Add beaten eggs, cream, and vanilla. Beat well. Add sifted flour, baking powder and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly.

  
  

Put through cookie press or chill and roll. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake in a hot oven for about 6-10 minutes, or until lightly brown in color.
