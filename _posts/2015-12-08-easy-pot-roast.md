This is a super each pot roast that you can serve with mashed potatoes, or you can add potatoes for the last half of the cooking time. It's funny how a recipe that takes 5 hours to cook actually requires less hands-on effort than most other meals.  
**Easy Pot Roast**  
  
~3-4 lb chuck roast  
1 tbsp McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning (or use kosher salt and freshly ground pepper)  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1 large yellow onion, chopped into large pieces  
1/2 lb of carrots, peeled and cut into roughly equal lengths (about 4 large carrots)  
3 sprigs of rosemary  
1 clove of garlic, diced or pressed  
1/2 bottle of red wine  
  
Preheat oven to 300°. Season the meat all over with the spice mixture. Heat a dutch oven or other heavy bottomed pot with a lid over medium heat. Add the olive oil to the hot pan and sear the chuck roast on each side (1-2 minutes each), then turn off the heat. Lift the roast out of the pot with tongs and scatter the onions in the bottom of the pot, then replace the roast. Add the carrots, rosemary, garlic, and the wine.  
  
Place the pot in the oven and cook for 4-5 hours, until the meat is fork tender. The internal temperature must reach up to 205° before the meat will become tender.
