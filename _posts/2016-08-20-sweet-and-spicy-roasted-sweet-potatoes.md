**Sweet and Spicy Roasted Sweet Potatoes**  
  
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1 inch cubes  
2 tbsp vegetable oil  
1 tbsp maple syrup  
1 tsp smoked paprika  
1/2 tsp cumin  
1/2 tsp garlic powder  
1/2 tsp coriander  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
  
Preheat oven to 425Â° and place a sheet pan inside to preheat.  
  
Add the potatoes, vegetable oil, maple syrup and spices to a mixing bowl. Stir together until potatoes are well coated with the spices.  
  
When the oven is preheated, remove the sheet pan and empty the potatoes onto the pan. Roast for approximately 35 minutes, stirring at least once during baking, until the potatoes begin to brown.
