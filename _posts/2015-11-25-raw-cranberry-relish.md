I love this tart and spicy relish to cut through the other, heavier sides served at thanksgiving. It couldn't be easier, because you simply throw the whole fruits into the food processor without removing the skin or seeds.  
  

  

**Raw Cranberry Relish**  
  
18 oz fresh cranberries  
2 tangerines, quartered  
1/2 lemon  
1/4 - Â 1/2 cup sugar (to taste, depending on tartness of fruit)  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1 tsp allspice  
  
Rinse cranberries and remove any stems. Add all ingredients to food processor and blend until fully combined and mixture becomes dark red.
