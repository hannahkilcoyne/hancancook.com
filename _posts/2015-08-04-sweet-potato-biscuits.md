I loved this recipe because it was so easy! This is the first time I have tried making dough in the food processor. It only took a second to come together, and then the cleanup was easy since the bowl fits in the dishwasher. You can definitely make this recipe with a pastry cutter if you have one, or just use your hands to mix the butter into the dry ingredients if not (this is usually my go to method for biscuits, but it is a lot messier).  
  
I used a Hannah yam, which I obviously buy because I like the name, but I actually think the drier texture of those yams worked well for these biscuits. I do think a regular sweet potato would give the biscuits a nice color though, so maybe I will try that next time.  
  

  
  
**Sweet Potato Biscuits**  
[Source](http://theviewfromgreatisland.com/down-home-sweet-potato-biscuits-with-country-gravy/)  
  
2 cups all purpose flour  
1 tbsp baking powder  
1 tsp salt  
3 tbsp sugar  
1/2 cup (1 stick) cold salted butter, cut into 1/2 inch cubes  
1/2 cup cooked sweet potato (I just microwaved mine until soft)  
1/2 cup cold milk  
  
Combine the dry ingredients in the food processor bowl. Add the butter straight from the fridge, and pulse the food processor a few times. Add the potato and pulse the food processor a few more times. Finally, add the milk and pulse the food processor once again until the mixture turns from crumbly to doughy, which will happen very quickly.  
  
On a floured surface, pat the dough out to about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut out 4 biscuits, and then reform the dough and cut out the remaining biscuits. Place the biscuits on a cookie sheet and place them in the freezer for 10 minutes.  
  
After 10 minutes, place the cookie sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown on top.  
  
Makes 8 biscuits.
