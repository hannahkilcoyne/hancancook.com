I pretty much devoured this tasty little dish of Fried Sweet Potatoes with Pomegranate Molasses when I tried it at River Bar in Somerville last month. I knew it was something I wanted to try to recreate at home. I already had a perfect recipe for [Pomegranate Wine Sauce](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/05/mini-koftas-and-pomegranate-wine-sauce.html), so I just had to put it all together. The only thing I left out was the pomegranate arils, because they are way too overpriced for me to buy them just to use them as a garnish, but if you for some reason have some already, they would be perfect here.  
  
  
I really love the combination of the crispy sweet potatoes, sweet and sour pomegranate sauce, and the big flakes of salt, and I hope you will too!  
  
**Sweet Potatoes with Pomegranate Wine Sauce**  
  
2 medium sized sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into ~1/2 inch dice  
2 tbsp olive oil  
Coarsely ground salt and black paper, to taste  
2 tbsp finely sliced green onions  
2 tbsp [Pomegranate Wine Sauce](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/05/mini-koftas-and-pomegranate-wine-sauce.html)  
  
Preheat oven to 400Â°. Put a sheet pan in the oven as it preheats.  
  
While the oven preheats, toss the potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper. Once preheated, remove the sheet pan from the oven and pour the potatoes onto the pan. The potatoes should sizzle. This will prevent the potatoes from sticking to your pan.  
  
Cook the potatoes for 35 - 40 minutes, until they become crispy and begin to brown. Turn the potatoes once after 20 minutes.  
  
In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the pomegranate wine sauce and half of the green onions. Serve the potatoes garnished with the other half of the green onions, plus another sprinkling of coarse salt.
