Years ago, right after watching a [certain episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrIgJ83E8-M) of Curb, I went to a party where someone brought a big plate of raspberry bars of some kind. I probably ate half of them myself, they were so delicious. I somehow ended up referring to them as raspberry bullshits, and the name has stuck in my head. These bars aren't exactly the same; I'm still searching for a recipe for those, and I believe box cake mix will come into play. But these were great, and a lot more "real". The shortbread crust was my favorite part. I will make these again, but in an ideal world I would look for a way to make them seedless. 

  

**Raspberry Bullshits (Raspberry Streusel Bars)**  
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour  
2/3 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 tsp table salt (1 tsp kosher salt)  
18 tbsp cool but softened butter (2 sticks + 2 tbsp) (I used 16 tbsp salted)  
1/2 cup rolled oats (I used quick cook)  
1/2 cup (2 oz) chopped pecans  
3/4 cup raspberry preserves  
3/4 cup fresh raspberries (3 1/2 oz)  
1 tsp fresh lemon juice  
  
Preheat the oven to 375°. Line a 13x9 inch pan with two overlapping pieces of foil, to allow for the ability to lift the bars out of the pan. Butter the foil.  
  
In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add 16 tbsp of butter and pulse until the mixture resembles course sand. Set aside 1 1/4 cups of the mixture. Add the rest of the mixture to the bottom of the pan. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to flatten the mixture into an even crust. Bake for 14 - 18 minutes until the crust begins to brown.  
  
Meanwhile, add the brown sugar, oats and pecans to the reserved flour mixture. Add the remaining 2 tbsp of butter and combine into a streusel using a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers.  
  
In a small bowl, combine the preserves, raspberries and lemon juice, and mash together with a fork. Spread the filling over the crust. Sprinkle the streusel on top. Bake for 22-25 minutes, until filling is bubbling and streusel is brown.  
  
Cool to room temperature before lifting the bars out of the plan with the foil. Slice into evenly sized squares or bars and serve.
