Pancakes used to baffle me. I would either burn them or flip them too soon and turn them into "scrambled pancakes." I eventually got more patient.

  
  

  
I thought I had it down then, but all along, all I needed was an electric griddle. An exact temperature setting and no frying pan sides in the way of the spatula, that is the key.  I am usually a basic bisquick pancakes girl, but these lemon ricotta pancakes are something special.  
  
**Lemon Ricotta Pancakes**  
  
1 1/2 cups flour  
1/4 cup sugar  
2 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 cup milk  
1 cup ricotta cheese  
3 large eggs  
1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
2 tbsp butter, melted  
Zest of two lemons  
1/4 cup lemon juice (juice of two lemons)  
  
Preheat an electric griddle to 375°.  
  
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a second bowl, mix together the milk, ricotta, eggs, vanilla extract and melted butter. Working very quickly, add the lemon zest and juice to the wet ingredients and stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Scoop the batter onto the griddle using a 1/3 or 1/2 cup measuring cup. When the pancakes begin to bubble on the top and the edges look dry, flip and cook for about 2 minutes on the second side, until golden brown. Serve with butter and maple syrup.  
  
Makes 10-12 pancakes.
