Truthfully, I am not usually a big fan of turkey, but this is the best turkey I've ever had. The smoke is not overpowering, but cooking it like this really makes the turkey come out delicious and moist. The juices were pouring out when I took the temperature with the thermapen. We would probably not make this rub for a Thanksgiving turkey, but we would use it again for barbecue turkey or chicken.  
  

  

  
  
  
Notes from the grill master.  

-   _Smoked using a Weber Smokey Mountain._
-   _Vents should be all the way open. The target lid temperature is 300°-325°._
-   _The water pan should be empty, but lined with foil to catch any drippings._ 
-   _Start with the standard method. Fill the base half way up with briquettes, to the first line. Then put 3 medium size (about 3 cubic inches each) of apple wood on top of the unlit briquettes. Light half a chimney (~20) briquettes. Pour the lit briquettes in the smoker on top of the wood. Close up the smoker with the turkey on the top rack._
-   _It took almost exactly 4 hours to get the white meat to 165°._

Rub is slightly adapted from the rub listed in [this forum post](http://www.smokingmeatforums.com/t/131366/smoking-a-chicken-need-brine-rub-and-direction).

## Ingredients

- 1 14 lb turkey
- 1/4 cup raw sugar
- 2 tbsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp cayenne (optional)
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp allspice
- 2 tsp Bell's Poultry Seasoning
- 2-3 tbsp vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Rinse the turkey inside and out, remove the giblets, and pat the turkey completely dry with paper towels.
1. In a small bowl, mix all the seasonings together. 
1. Rub the turkey all over with the vegetable oil, then rub in the seasoning. 
1. Smoke the turkey. (This is the easy part, Ryan just goes outside for a minute, and then 4 hours later it's magically done!)
