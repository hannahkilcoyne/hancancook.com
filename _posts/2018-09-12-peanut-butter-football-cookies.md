![Image of Peanut Butter Football Cookies.](/upload/pf1.jpg)

Let it be known that Ryan drew these laces.

  
These cookies represent the start of my football snack season 2018. I don't really care about this games so this is the fun part for me. The specific request was for "Peanut Butter Football Cookies" so this is the best I could do. This recipe from the failing New York Times is really for peanut butter blossoms. I left in the instructions for the traditional peanut butter blossoms because I'm sure the classic Hershey's Kisses version would be great. Honestly, I would leave them plain if I wasn't going for a theme.

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 8 tbsp softened butter
- 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar + 2 tbsp for rolling
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 4 oz milk chocolate (or 5 dozen hershey's kisses)
- White cookie decoration icing

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°
1. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium sized bowl. 
1. In a large bowl, cream the butter, peanut butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, milk and vanilla.
1. Add the flour mixture gradually into the wet mixture until fully combined. 
1. Scoop out equally sized portions of dough (I used a 1.5 tbsp scoop) and roll into balls. Sprinkle 2 tbsp of sugar into a shallow bowl and roll each ball through the sugar. 
1. Place each ball onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Flatten each with a heavy bottomed glass and pinch the ends into football shapes. Bake for 9 - 11 minutes until very lightly browned, then cool on wire racks. (Alternately, just form 5 dozen 1 inch balls and bake the balls for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and press a hershey's kiss into the top of each cookie, then bake for an additional 3-5 minutes.)
1. While the cookies bake, melt the chocolate in a double boiler or microwave and add to a pastry bag or ziplock bag with a corner snipped. Draw football shapes onto each cookie and smooth with a knife. Once the chocolate has set, draw on laces with white icing.
