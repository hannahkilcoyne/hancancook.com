Unlike some of the other seasonal recipes I've posted, this isn't one that I ate growing up, it's someone else's favorite fall recipe. I got my hands on the recipe and I've been saving it for years, since a time way Before Pinterest. This cake is ridiculously moist and delicious (I can definitively say that this is the only recipe I've ever made with 1 full cup of vegetable oil in it) and the cream cheese frosting is the perfect accompaniment.  

  

Some notes on the recipe - I had to use a smaller pan than a regular jelly roll pan so these came out thicker than they normally would. Also the frosting recipe originally called for 4 cups of confectioner's sugar but I only added 3 and thought it was plenty, so I would recommend that you taste as you go.  
  
  
  
**Pumpkin Squares**  
  

2 cups sugar  
1 cup vegetable oil  
4 eggs  
2 cups flour  
2 tsp baking soda  
1 pinch salt  
1 ½ tsp cinnamon  
2 cups canned pumpkin  
  
For the frosting:  
1 stick butter  
1 8 oz bar of cream cheese, softened  
3 - 4 cups powdered sugar (I used 3)  
1 tsp vanilla  
  
Preheat oven to 350°.  
  
Beat sugar, oil, eggs. Sift together flour, soda and salt. Add to egg mixture, then add cinnamon and pumpkin. Spread in ungreased jelly roll pan. Bake for 25-35 minutes, checking frequently with a toothpick.  
  
Spread frosting on cooled bars.
