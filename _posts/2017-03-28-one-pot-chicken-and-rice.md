**One Pot Chicken and Rice**  
  
2 tbsp olive oil  
2 large or 3 small chicken breasts (1 1/4 lbs)  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  
2 tsp smoked paprika (or ancho chile powder, if desired)  
1 medium onion, diced  
1 cup white (I use basmati) rice  
4 cloves garlic, diced or pressed  
1 1/2 cup (or roughly a 14.5 oz can) of chicken broth  
1 (15 oz) can of black beans, drained and rinsed  
1 bunch of green onions, chopped  
Lime wedges  
  
Heat a dutch oven over medium heat. Add the olive oil. Season the chicken on both sides with salt, pepper and 1 tsp of the smoked paprika. Brown the chicken in the oil for 2-3 minutes per side, then remove the chicken to a plate. It will not be cooked through at this time.  
  
Add the onion and the rice to the pot and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and the second teaspoon of smoked paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes.  
  
While the rice cooks, cut the chicken into one inch pieces. Add the chicken and black beans to the rice, stir, and cook for an additional 12 minutes, until the rice is cooked.  
  
Stir in the green onions and serve with lime wedges.
