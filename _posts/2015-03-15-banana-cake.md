I went searching for a banana bread recipe solely to use up some overripe bananas that were kicking around. The [recipe I found](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/banana-banana-bread/) had great ratings and looked like it would be perfect. As it turns out I don't own a loaf pan and can't make banana bread, so I'm not sure what I was thinking there. Instead, I made banana cake! The cake actually came out perfectly - it's very moist and not too sweet, with a delicious buttery crust on top.  
  

  
  

  
**Banana Cake**  
  
2 cups all purpose flour  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 cup (1 stick) softened butter  
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar  
2 eggs  
2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas (~5 bananas)  
1/2 tsp cinnamon  
  
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease a 9x9 pan.  
  
Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a large bowl.  
  
With a mixer, cream together the butter and brown sugar. Add the eggs and bananas. Finally, stir in the cinnamon.  
  
Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry mixture and stir together by hand until just combined. Pour the mixture into the pan.  
  
Bake for 40-45 minutes, until a knife comes out clean.
