I picked up this baby black forest ham (just under 2 pounds) on sale from Whole Foods the day after Christmas. I wanted to do a simple glaze, but had to find something that would be appropriate for this mustard free house. The internet didn't turn up anything promising so I made up my own extremely simple glaze.  
  
**Black Forest Ham with Brown Sugar Glaze**  
  
1 pre-cooked, 2 pound, Black Forest Ham  
1/2 cup (packed) Brown Sugar  
2 teaspoons Apple Cider Vinegar  
  
Preheat oven to 325°. I let the ham sit out and come to room temperature while the oven preheated. I probably should have given it more time to take the chill off, but luckily my lack of planning ahead didn't seem to cause any problems with such a small ham.  

  

Line a small baker with parchment paper or foil. Bake the ham for 30 minutes without any glaze.  

  

While the ham is cooking, mix the vinegar and brown sugar. It will basically form a paste that you can press onto the outside of the ham. Bake the ham for 20 to 30 more minutes. Check the ham with a meat thermometer - the recommended internal temperature for ham is 140° but since this was a pre-cooked ham I waited for it to reach 110° and then took it out.

  

I saved the drippings from the bottom of the pan, and it was delicious drizzled on the ham.
