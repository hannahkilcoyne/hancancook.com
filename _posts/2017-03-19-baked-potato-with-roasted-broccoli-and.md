I really like this recipe because it's like junk food, but it has roasted broccoli on it. It basically tastes like broccoli cheddar soup, but not in soup form.  
  
**Baked Potato with Roasted Broccoli and Cheddar Cheese Sauce**  
  
2 large baking potatoes, washed and dried  
2 medium sized broccoli crowns, washed, dried and cut into pieces  
2 tbsp olive oil  
Salt and freshly ground pepper  
2 tbsp butter  
2 tbsp all purpose flour  
1 cup whole milk  
1 cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese  
Pinch of nutmeg  
  
Preheat the oven to 425°.  Prick the potatoes with a sharp knife and place in the oven to bake. Also place a large baking sheet in the oven.  
  
Add the broccoli to a mixing bowl and coat with the olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.   
  
After 35 minutes, pour the broccoli out evenly onto the preheated baking sheet and place in the oven with the potatoes. Roast the broccoli and bake the potatoes for an additional 25-30 minutes, until broccoli begins to brown and the potatoes are softened.  
  
While the broccoli roasts, make the cheese sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour into the melted butter and whisk together until smooth. Pour the milk slowly into the roux and whisk together again. Add a small pinch of nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Continue stirring until the mixture begins to bubble. The mixture will thicken. Remove from heat and stir in the cheese.   
  
Assemble the potatoes with the cheese sauce and broccoli. Serve and enjoy!
