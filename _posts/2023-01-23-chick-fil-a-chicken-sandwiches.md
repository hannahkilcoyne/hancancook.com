## Ingredients

- 2 lbs chicken breast cutlets (6-8 cutlets)
- 1/2 cup dill pickle juice
- 1 quart of vegetable oil
- 2 cups flour
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp butter
- 8 hamburger buns 
- Pickle chips

## Instructions

1. Add the chicken and pickle juice to a large ziplock bag or covered bowl and marinate for 8 to 24 hours.
1. When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 200° F. Add the oil to a heavy dutch oven over medium heat and bring to 350° F, measuring the temperature frequently.
1. Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk together the flour, powdered sugar, baking powder and spices.
1. Add an egg to the pickle juice marinade and whisk together. Remove each piece of chicken from the egg/marinade mixture and dredge in the flour mixture. 
1. Carefully place two cutlets at a time in the frying oil once it is at 350°. Cook for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, flip, and cook for another 2 minutes and 30 seconds on the second side. Remove each piece to a wire rack set on a baking pan and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. 
1. Keep the chicken warm in the oven while cooking the remaining batches. When ready to serve, melt the butter in a frying pan and grill each bun face down in the butter until golden brown. Serve each sandwich with 2 pickle chips.
