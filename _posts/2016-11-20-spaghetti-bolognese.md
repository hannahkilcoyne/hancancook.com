My go to basic tomato sauce is Marcella Hazan’s 3 ingredient [Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter](http://steamykitchen.com/8375-marcella-hazan-tomato-sauce-with-onion-butter.html), so when I came across this recipe for Spaghetti Bolognese I decided to try it. Most importantly, Ryan liked it.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup chopped onion (approx. 1/2 an onion)
- 2/3 cup chopped celery
- 2/3 cup chopped carrot
- 3/4 pound ground beef chuck
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1 cup whole milk
- Pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 28 oz canned whole tomatoes, chopped up with a food processor, with liquid
- 1 lb spaghetti
- Parmesan for garnish

## Instructions

1. Heat a large pot on medium heat. Add the oil, followed by the onion, and sauté the onion until it becomes translucent. Add the celery and carrot and cook for an additional two minutes.  
1. Add ground beef, and season with salt and pepper. Brown the beef. Then add the milk and simmer until it nearly evaporates, stirring frequently. Add the nutmeg. 
1. Pour the wine into the pot and simmer again until it nearly evaporates. Add the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and then turn down to low. Cook uncovered for 3-4 hours. Add water occasionally if the sauce become too dry, and spoon off any fat that rises to the top. 
1. Mix together freshly cooked pasta and sauce on the stove. Garnish with parmesan and serve.
