The [kale chips](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2016/03/kale-chips.html) I posted before are definitely a favorite, but this recipe is like the lower effort cousin of the kale chips. Kale is very hearty and forgiving to cook, so it's hard to screw this recipe up. Timing is not as critical as it is with kale chips, or with more delicate greens like spinach.  
  
Of all places, this recipe was inspired by a side I got at an airport while I was on a work trip. Usually the food I can find when I'm traveling is not anything special, so I guess the combination of being starving and being so thrilled to be eating something green made an impression on me.  
  
The combination of the garlic, lemon and seasoning gives the kale a really savory, almost meaty flavor. Don't read too much into that; I like to serve this side with a steak, so I'm not trying to say kale is a meat replacement. But seriously it is so so good.  
  

  
  
**Garlic and Lemon Sautéed Kale**  
  
1 bunch of curly kale, de-stemmed and washed  
3 tbsp olive oil  
2-3 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed  
Juice of 1/2 a lemon  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
  
Heat a large straight sided skillet (or even a wide bottomed pot) over medium heat. Add the olive oil to the hot pan. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds to a minute. Avoid scorching the garlic. Add the kale to the pan and toss to distribute the garlic. Add the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue to sauté the kale until it is wilted. Serve immediately.
