# Jelly Cookies

- ¾ cup butter, softened
- ⅔ cup sugar
- ¼ tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tbsp light cream
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 cups flour

Preheat oven to 325

Beat together butter and sugar until mixture is light. Add yolks, cream, and vanilla. Beat until fluffy.

Gradually add flour until it is well combined and dough is smooth. Divide dough into four equal parts and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Roll out dough to ¼ inch thickness. Cut out cookies. Cut centers out of half of the cookies. Bake 12-15 minutes or until edges of cookies are golden.

After baking, put one whole cookie and one cut-out cookie together with jelly.
