I haven't attempted to make pumpkin bread pudding for 7 or 8 years. The last time I made it, I was following a recipe that called for a ratio of 2 entire cups of sugar to 4 cups of bread cubes - insane. This recipe is much less sweet, and much more buttery, which is how I like my bread pudding. The custard has just the right amount of pumpkin and spices.  
  
While this recipe is a keeper, I think some more tweaks are possible. Next time, I might try this with less bread so that the overall mixture is even more custardy. I might also try it in a smaller dish to reduce the surface area that gets crispy on top.  
  

  
  
**Pumpkin Bread Pudding**  
1 pound of day old white bread, cubed into 1 inch pieces  
1 cup light cream  
1/2 cup whole milk  
1/2 cup sugar  
3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree  
2 large eggs  
1/4 tsp salt  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1/2 tsp ground ginger  
Pinch of allspice  
Pinch of ground cloves  
6 tbsp butter, melted  
  
Preheat the oven to 250°. Spread the bread cubes out over two baking sheets and bake for 15 minutes to remove some moisture from the day old bread. This step can be omitted if the bread is stale already.  
  
Preheat the oven to 350°. Whisk together the cream, milk, sugar, pumpkin, eggs, salt and spices.  
  
In a large bowl, toss the bread cubes with the melted butter. Then pour the egg mixture over the bread cubes and toss everything together to evenly distribute the mixture.  
  
Bake in an 8x8 baking dish for 25 to 30 minutes until firm and beginning to brown on top.
