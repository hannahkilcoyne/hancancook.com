**Cilantro Vinaigrette**  
  
Juice of 1 lemon or lime (about 1/4 cup)  
1/4 cup olive oil  
About a cup's worth of fresh cilantro (half a bunch or so)  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
  
Blend together the juice, oil, cilantro, salt and pepper. Serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator for a day or two.  
  
This recipe is extremely versatile. It can easily be scaled up. You can use up the stems of the cilantro if that's what you have. You can blend this in a regular blender, magic bullet type blender, or using an immersion blender.
