This week's football game snack: Potato skins! I'm trying to figure out why I haven't eaten potato skins in forever. I kind of forgot they existed. Now that I know how easy they are to make, I think I should start eating these a lot more often. Man, these were good!  
  
I halved the recipe below. Next time, I think it would be amazing to bake all the potatoes, and save half of the shells for later use.  
  
  
Preheat the oven to 400°. Scrub the potatoes, pierce each potato a few times with a fork, and oil the outsides with olive oil. Bake for about 60 minutes, until the insides are beginning to soften. Remove the baked potatoes from the oven and allow them to cool enough that you can handle them.  
  

While the potatoes are baking, cook the bacon in a frying pan over medium low heat. Drain the bacon on paper towels, then dice or crumble the bacon into bits.  
  

Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Using a sharp edged spoon, scrape the insides of the potato skins out, leaving a 1/4 inch shell of potato in the skin. Save the insides for another use, like mashed potatoes.  
  

Increase the oven temperature to 450°. Oil the potatoes again to help them crisp up. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Line the potatoes up on a baking sheet and cook for 10 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for 10 minutes on the other side.  
  

Remove the shells from the oven. Divide the cheese and bacon bits over the shells. Broil for two minutes, watching very closely, until the cheese begins to bubble.  
  
Top with green onions and sour cream (optional) to serve.
