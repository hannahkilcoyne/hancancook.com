**Lemon Rosemary Potatoes**  
Serves 2  
  
2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large cubes  
1 lemon, juiced (about 1/4 cup lemon juice)  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1 large sprig of fresh rosemary, chopped (about 1 tbsp)  
Salt and freshly ground pepper  
  
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Place your baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.  
  
Bring a pot of water to a boil while cubing the potatoes. Add the potatoes to the water and parboil them until they just begin to soften (about 2-3 minutes). Drain the potatoes.  
  
Toss together the potatoes, lemon juice, olive oil and rosemary in a large bowl. Season the potatoes all over with salt and pepper.  
  
Cook the potatoes on the preheated baking sheet for 45-60 minutes, until browned.  
  
This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.
