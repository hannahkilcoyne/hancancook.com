This is a remake of a salad I can't stop ordering for lunch delivery. For a salad to be satisfying, it can't be one note. I think the reason this salad is so addicting is the balance of salty and sweet flavors.  
  
**Kale Salad with Pear and Golden Beets**  
  
1-2 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice  
1-2 tbsp olive oil  
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  
8 oz of kale, washed, dried and chopped  
1 roasted golden beet, diced  
1 anjou pear, Â peeled and sliced  
1 tbsp freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus garnish  
Pinch of cayenne pepper  
  
Whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper in a small bowl. In a large bowl, massage the dressing into the kale. Add the beets, pears, parmesan and pepper. Toss to combine. Garnish with more parmesan.
