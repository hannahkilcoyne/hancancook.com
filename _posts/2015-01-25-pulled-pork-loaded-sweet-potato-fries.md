This recipe was inspired by a really great appetizer we tried on a weekend in [Maine](http://grittys.com/pubs/freeport/) a few years ago. I thought that barbecue pulled pork and sweet potato fries sounded like a weird combination, but Ryan was sure it would be good, and as usual, he was right. Obviously it was memorable because I'm still thinking about how to recreate it. That's the down side to having great food on vacation - you don't know when you're going to get to eat it again. This did not turn out exactly the same as the restaurant's version (I might have to make another attempt sometime), but it was delicious nonetheless. This was a great way to use part of a batch of pulled pork.  
  
**Pulled Pork Loaded Sweet Potato Fries**  
[Dr. Pepper Pulled Pork](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/01/dr-pepper-pulled-pork.html)  
Sweet Potato Fries (I used Alexia)  
Shredded Cheddar/Monterey Jack Cheese  
  
Bake the sweet potato fries until crispy, following the instructions or recipe for the fries you're using.  
  
At the same time, if the pulled pork you're using is left-over, re-heat the pork. I added mine to a pan with some of the cooking liquid and heated it in a 425Â° oven for 10-15 minutes.  
  
Sprinkle the fries with cheese, and melt the cheese over the fries in the oven for 2-4 minutes. Once the cheese is melted, add the pork to the top. That's it!
