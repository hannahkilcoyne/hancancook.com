The combination of the crispy parmesan breading on the chicken and the tart salad on top makes this a great summer meal.  
  
**Parmesan Crusted Chicken with Lemon Vinaigrette Salad**  
  
From [Barefoot Contessa Family Style by Ina Garten](http://barefootcontessa.com/recipes.aspx?RecipeID=371&S=0)  
  
For the chicken:  
4 small chicken breasts  
1/2 cup all purpose flour  
1 tsp salt  
1 tsp pepper  
1 large egg  
1 cup seasoned Panko breadcrumbs  
1/4 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese  
2 tbsp butter  
2 tbsp vegetable oil  
  
For the salad:  
4 ounces (~1 bag) mixed salad greens (I used red and green butter lettuce)  
2 tbsp lemon juice  
2 tbsp olive oil  
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  
  
  
Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness.  
  
Combine the flour with the salt and pepper in a shallow bowl (or pie plate). In a second bowl, whisk the egg with a teaspoon of water. In a third bowl, combine the panko with the parmesan cheese.  
  
Dredge each chicken breast in the flour mixture, then dip the chicken in the egg mixture. Last, dip each chicken breast in the panko, pressing the mixture onto the chicken to cover it on all sides.  
  
Heat a frying pan on medium to medium low heat, and once it is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Cook the first two chicken breasts, 3 minutes per side, until cooked through. Add the remaining butter and oil, and cook the second two chicken breasts.  
  
While the chicken is cooking, stir together the olive oil and lemon juice, adding a dash of salt and pepper to taste, in a small bowl or measuring cup. Toss the salad greens in the vinaigrette, careful not to overdress them.  
  
Serve the chicken breasts with the salad heaped on top. Enjoy!
