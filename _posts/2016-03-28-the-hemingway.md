This brunch cocktail is inspired by one served at [Armsby Abbey](http://armsbyabbey.com/) in Worcester, MA. I've never tried the original, but I'm a big fan of this recipe. The grapefruit is nice and citruisy, which is all the better to help me in my ongoing quest to consume more pancakes.  
  
**The Hemingway**  
  
3 oz ruby red grapefruit juice  
1 oz white rum  
1/2 oz maraschino liqueur  
1/2 oz lime juice  
Ice for shaker  
Lime wedge for garnish  
  
Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker and shake together. Strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with lime wedge.
