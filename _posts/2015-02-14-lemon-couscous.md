I'm not sure that this couscous is worth posting; it couldn't be more basic, but it is something I have made multiple times, and it makes a great background dish for more exciting mains dishes like these [Moroccan Meatballs](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/02/moroccan-meatballs.html). And I just love lemon.  
  
**Lemon Couscous**  
  
1 package Near East Plain/Original Couscous  
2 tbsp olive oil  
Zest of 1 lemon  
Juice of 1 lemon  
~2 cups water  
  
Bring the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, and enough water to bring the mixture to 2 cups of liquid. When the mixture reaches a rolling boil, remove from heat and add the couscous. Allow to site for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork and serve.
