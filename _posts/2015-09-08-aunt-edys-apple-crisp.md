I have made reference here to my Treasured Recipes google doc [before](http://www.hannahkilcoyne.com/2015/01/vanilla-sugar-cookies.html), and this is another top recipe from my files. In my opinion, this is the best apple crisp ever. I remember tasting someone else's self proclaimed best apple crisp ever many years ago, and realizing acutely how often "best ever" can just be translated to "the version I grew up with". That is certainly the case here. The title of this recipe comes not from me, but from my Grandmother - this is her aunt Edy's recipe for apple crisp, and I kind of like the idea that it has been made by people in my family for generations.  
  

  
  
**Aunt Edy's Apple Crisp**  
  
5-6 cups sliced apples  
½ to 1 cup sugar  
1 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp cinnamon  
¾ tsp salt  
1 unbeaten egg  
1 cup flour  
½ cup melted butter  
  
Preheat oven to 325°  
  
Place apples in a greased baking pan (6x10). Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and egg together until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Pour melted and cooled butter over all. Sprinkle with cinnamon.  
  
Bake for 30-40 minutes.
